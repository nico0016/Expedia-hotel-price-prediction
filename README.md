    basic_model_pipeline_v2.ipynb:
        - use 5000 examples
        - basic code pipeline for modeling, try basic regression model, e.g., linear regression, ridge regression, etc.
    
    basic_model_pipeline_v3.ipynb:
        - using 10000 examples 
        - basic code pipeline for modeling, try basic regression model, e.g., linear regression, ridge regression, etc.
