# Project Goal

The overall goal of this project is to build a hotel room rate prediction system that helps customers to evaluate the price and determine the best time to book a room for traveling. Several questions that we would like to answer include:
* When we book hotel, how can we know the price is reasonable or overcharged? 
* Can we have a number to benchmark?
* Can we know the fluctuation of hotel room price by season?
These are the questions that we want to answer throughout this project.


## Data Overview

We use Personalize Expedia hotel searches â€“ ICDM 2013 from online Kaggle competition ( > 4GB), which includes a wide variety of data on User, Property, time, competitor, etc. It contained nearly 10 million historical hotel search results representing approximately 400 thousand unique search queries on the popular travel booking website Expedia.com. 
* Features: ~ 54 features, which can be divided into several sub-categories:
    * Search (time, location, etc.) 
    * User (country, historical data, etc.) 
    * Hotel (price, star, reviews, etc.)


## Data Preprocess

1. Handle missing data
    * To handle variables with missing data > 50%, we would create a binary variable as indictor of whether the data is missing or not for a specific data record 
    * If variable with missing data < 50%, we would replace NA values with median values
    
2. Outlier value detection
    * hotel room rates can have as low as $0.2/night, and as high as $+5m/night; we remove those outliers that are significantly deviated from the rest of hotel room rate distribution
    
3. Convert categorical variables to continuous variables
    * for categorical variables with more than 100 instances, e.g., country_id, destination_id, property_id, etc. it wouldn't make sense to one-hot encoding them all; so what we did is to compute the popularity, i.e., how many times each instance of a category ever appear in the dataset to represent the instance itself. For example, for property_id = 116942, we count how many records with property_id = 116942 are there in the dataset, and use that continuous number to represent property_id = 116942. Same logic and transformation is applied to country_id and destination_id as well as other categorical variables.

4. Aggregate data based on time range
    * Our ultimate goal is to predict hotel room rate for one property listing in one single day. However, from the Expedia dataset, it only lists the data per user search and potential at multiple timestamps within a day, so we would need to aggregate the data by day. 
    
5. Log transform skewed data

## Feature Importance



## Modeling

We applied a multi-stage modeling approach to resolve the complexity of the problem, by dividing them into several subproblems that are easier to tackle.
